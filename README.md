CheckMate
</h1>    

This is a simple Todo List application built using React. The application allows users to add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as completed. Each task can also have a due date.

## Features

- Add new tasks with a title, description, and   due date
- Edit existing tasks
- Delete tasks
- Mark tasks as completed
- Save tasks to local storage

## Technologies Used

- **React**: In this CheckMate web app, React is used to create reusable UI components for tasks, headers, and forms. It helps in managing the state of the application efficiently, ensuring that changes in the task list are reflected immediately in the UI.

- **CSS Modules**: In CheckMate CSS Modules are used in this project to style the components without worrying about class name collisions, allowing for modular and maintainable CSS. Each component has its own CSS module file, ensuring that styles are applied locally and do not leak into other components.

- **React Icons**: This app uses React Icons to provide visual cues and enhance the user interface with icons for adding, editing, deleting, and marking tasks as completed. Icons improve the user experience by making the application more intuitive.

- **NodeJS**: NodeJS is used to run the development server for this React application. It manages dependencies through npm (Node Package Manager) and allows the use of modern JavaScript features and tools like Webpack and Babel, which are essential for building and bundling React applications.
